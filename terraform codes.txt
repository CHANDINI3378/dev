 Subject : Casual leave Application

           Dear Madam,

           I hope this message finds you well. I am writing to formally request leave from work on 11-12-2024 to 13-12-2024, as I am planning to visit 
           Tirupati for personal reasons.

           I assure you that I will complete all my pending work before my leave and ensure a smooth handover of any tasks if required. Please let me know 
           if you need any further details or arrangements from my side.

          Thank you for considering my request. I look forward to your approval.

          Sincerely,

          R. Chandini
